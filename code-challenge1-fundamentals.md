Basics- This is a swell reminder of how obejects work. The use of fucntions within objects was a new element to become familiar with.

Computed Properties- Holy shit! I figured it out! This is one of the first times in a while that I figured out something so foreign to my intuitive knowledge. Anyhoo. Excited. I've learned more about how functions and computed key names can be used to make key value properties

Class Creation - These tests ask of us to understand how classes are made. Unique elements include a stronger understanding of blocks, hoisting, the difference between var and const/let in blocks, how constructors work, and how methods are called within classes. I cannot seem to find the answer to 'a class is block scoped'. 

Statics - Static methods and properties are not called on each instance of the class, but on the class itself. We are learning more about its scope and usage. I imagine this is among other things a redundancy-saving tool?

Extends - Shows us how classes can inherit from each other. in other words, Classes can be children of other classes.

Destructuring:
Arrays - Figuring out how array variables can be swapped, called, extracted.
Strings - Each character in a string can be made to represent one element in array
Objects - If I am hoonest, this section makes the least sense to me. I had trouble understanding why tests were or weren't passing.
defaults - the idea that values can be set as fallbacks. Ways to have a value be given to an item even if it hasn't been defined yet.
Function Parameters - These exercises introduce us to how defaultsparameters behave in functions, and how to anticipate using them.
Alias - This whole one was Greek to me, if I am honest...

Rest- This explains how to use the ... rest as ways to shorthand the "leftovers" in an arguement. Keeping in mind that the 'rest' will be called as an array.
Rest with Destructuring - I see how using rest can be convenient and simplifying. Whats the difference between rest and spread?

Spread: spread is an effective way of calling an array. Particularly in places , like constructors, where calling an array is dicey.
